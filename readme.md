## Introduction

The "Grokking Algorithms" book is a fantastic resource for understanding fundamental algorithms and data structures. This repository aims to provide Python implementations for the algorithms covered in the book, along with corresponding tests.

Feel free to use this code as a reference while reading the book or as a supplement to your algorithmic studies. Contributions and improvements are welcome!

## Getting Started

To get started with the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ayo-awe/grokking-algorithms.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
   cd grokking-algorithms-python
```

## Algorithm List

The following algorithms and exercises from the book are implemented in this repository:

- Binary Search
- Selection Sort
- Recursive Max
- Recursive Len

Each algorithm has its own dedicated Python file in the algorithms directory.

## Running Tests

Tests are included for each algorithm to verify their correctness. To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```

This command will discover and run all tests in the tests directory.

## Contributing

Contributions are highly encouraged! If you find any issues, have suggestions for improvements, or want to add new algorithms, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Make sure to follow the existing code style and include relevant test cases.
